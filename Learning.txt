1. Python most_common() Function
The most_common() function is a method provided by the Counter class in Pythonâ€™s collections module. It returns a list of the n most common elements and their counts from a collection, sorted by frequency.

Example:

Here, we are using the most_common() function to arrange elements according to the frequency in decreasing order.

from collections import Counter

# Sample data
data = ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple']

# Create a Counter object
counter = Counter(data)

# elements according to the frequency in decreasing order
most_common_elements = counter.most_common()

print(most_common_elements)
